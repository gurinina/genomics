# Saccharomyces cerevisiae dataset
<img src="figures/04-workflow-overview.png" width=400>


This section of the OMICS course will cover NGS sequencing from FASTQ reads to differential RNA analysis. The general workflow is shown above. We will use a dataset from Saccharomyces cereviseae. The bookdown version of these pages is published at this site [RNA-genomics](https://bookdown.org/ggiaever/RNA-genomics/).
